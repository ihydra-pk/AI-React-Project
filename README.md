AI/React Internship Test Assignment
This assignment contains open-ended questions. Please do your best to complete as
much as you can. The purpose of this test is to evaluate your capabilities in frontend,
backend, and AI technologies. We're not so much interested in what you know or if you
know this stuff, as in how you tackle the brain-boggling puzzles of this coding
multiverse.
Deadline: End of this month (2023-09-30)
Please submit your completed assignment via email to jobs@optiwiseit.com with the subject
name "AI Internship".
Objective
Develop an interactive web platform where users can provide a story prompt, and the AI
generates a short story based on that prompt. Additionally, users should be able to upvote their
favorite generated stories, which are then showcased on a leaderboard.
Frontend
- Design a captivating interface using React.
- Implement a form where users can provide a story prompt (e.g., "In a city where everyone can
fly...", "Once upon a time in a digital world...").
- Display the generated story and allow users to read, save, or share it.
- Create a leaderboard showcasing top-voted stories with their prompts.
Backend
- Choose a robust backend framework like Node.js or Flask.
- Store generated stories, user prompts, and upvotes in a database.
- Implement an API endpoint for the AI model to receive prompts and return generated stories.
AI
- Utilize a state-of-the-art text generation model like GPT-3 or GPT-4 from OpenAI.
- Fine-tune the model (if possible) for short story generation to ensure the output is coherent
and engaging.
- Ensure efficient resource management, as these models can be resource-intensive, possibly
by setting a maximum word limit or using asynchronous processing.
Bonus Challenges
- Implement a feature allowing users to continue an existing story, generating a collaborative
chain story with the AI.
- Incorporate user feedback mechanisms (like tags for humor, suspense, etc.) and allow users to
request stories with specific tones or themes.
